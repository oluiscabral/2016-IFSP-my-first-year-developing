# IFSP-first-year-developing
My first year of contact with programming. All applications were developed in 2016, at the time I was in the first year of technical high school

Observations: 
- All application were assignments which counted towards the overall grade of technical high school.
- TP means Trabalho Pr√°tico, which translated from portuguese means Practical Assignments
